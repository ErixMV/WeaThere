## About the Project
This project was started in order to improve my skills using APIs and data management. The initial version has a very simple layout with only temperature data. In future versions, more data will be added and layout will be improved.

### Built With
The project is totally made in [React](https://es.reactjs.org).


The retrived data come from:<br />
[Algolia Places](https://community.algolia.com/places/) for cities.<br />
[Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io) for weather forecast.

## Usage
The search input will display cities as suggestions in a dropdown depending on input's current value. Select a city and the weather forecast will be displayed.

You can get the forecast from your current position by clicking the pin on the right side of the search input.

## Roadmap

This is a list of future implementations:

* Toggle between Â°C and F.
* Display from a selected day (today by default): Hourly forecast, pressure, humidity and rain probability.
* Layout improvement.
* Dark Mode

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ErixMV/WeaThere/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
